                New Jobs Friday UK is a weekly newsletter that delivers all the latest job offers in the UK music industry to your inbox.
                <br /><br />
                New Jobs Friday UK was created to simplify your job search - instead of looking up all the various websites listing job offers in the UK Music industry you can just get them all in your inbox every Friday at 12pm UK time.

                Yes, we list job offers from all over the UK. You’ll find that the majority of roles listed in the newsletter are from London and surroundings, but this is more due to the nature of the UK music industry being concentrated in and around London. We’ve previously had offers for jobs located in Birmingham, Liverpool and many other cities in the UK.
