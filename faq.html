                                New Jobs Friday UK is a weekly newsletter that delivers all the latest job offers in the UK music industry to your inbox.
                                <br /><br />
                                New Jobs Friday UK was created to simplify your job search - instead of looking up all the various websites listing job offers in the UK Music industry you can just get them all in your inbox every Friday at 12pm UK time.

You’ll find that the majority of roles listed in the newsletter are from London and surroundings, but this is more due to the nature of the UK music industry being concentrated in and around London. We’ve previously had offers for jobs located in Birmingham, Liverpool and many other cities in the UK.

                                New Jobs Friday UK is an aggregator newsletter so as an employer there are different ways you can get your job offer listed in one of our issues:
                                <br /><br />
                                1. List your position on one of the job boards we’re aggregating offers from - see previous questions for the full list - and your job will automatically be included in the next newsletter.
                                <br /><br />
                                2. <a href="mailto:newjobsfriday@gmail.com">Contact us</a> to get your job added to the next newsletter. The job description will need to be available on your company website or a third party website (e.g. LinkedIn, HR platform, job board). We’ll also need to know the role title, company name and location (City).
                                <br /><br />
                                3. Promote your job offer on the newsletter - see next question for more details.

                                Yes, there are 2 ways you can promote your job offer in the newsletter to get more visibility and increase the number of applicants.
                                <br /><br />
                                <b>Job Of The Week</b> - advertise your job offer at the very top of the weekly newsletter, in a dedicated section, before the rest of the job offers for that week.
                                <br /><br />
                                <b>Push Notification</b> - advertise your job offer in a dedicated email going out to our whole mailing list on the day of your choice (except Friday).
                                <br /><br />
